# Putting the R in JupyteR notebooks
OxfordR Talk from December 2nd 2019

This talk will give an overview of what Jupyter notebooks are, run through the installation and set-up of using Jupyter notebooks with R, give a live demo of how to get started working with Jupyter notebooks for some simple exploratory data analysis, and do some comparisons between using RMarkdown and R with Jupyter for EDA/communication of your results.
